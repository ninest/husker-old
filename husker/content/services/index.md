## FAQ

### How do I find my co-op cycle?

Open [Registrar Self Service](https://nubanner.neu.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB?pkg=twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_StuMainMnu), then

- Click "Registration"
- Click "Patterns of Attendance"

The link for Registrar Self Service is available under "Services".

If that doesn't work, you can find it on the Student Hub. Open the [Student Hub](https://me.northeastern.edu/), then

- Click "Resources" (top bar)
- Click "{% icon id="commentalt" / %} Academics, Classes & Registration"
- Click "Registrar Self Service"
- Click "Registration"
- Click "Patterns of Attendance"

Under the the **Patterns of Attendance** column, you should see your cycle. For example, "CO-OP S2/FL" means you're in the Summer 2 and Fall cycle.
