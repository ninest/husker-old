## FAQ

### Why do I need to do this course if I already know a programming language?

Fundies 1 focuses on teaching you to think like a computer scientist rather than teaching you programming or Racket.

### Why is Racket used?

- To teach functional programming.
- To "level the playing field" so that those with programming experience do not have too much of an advantage over those programming for the first time. Racket will be unfamiliar even to those with prior programming experience.

### Should I go to lab?

Yes, as they have a practical problem to solve with your partner, and access to tutors/TAs to ask any questions

### What should I do if I am having an issue with your partner?

If your partner doesn't show up to labs/meetings for homework, tell your TA or tutor (not your professor).

If you disagree with your partner, you have to work it out together.

### Can I use a Mac?

Yes, any computer will work as long as it [supports Racket](https://racket-lang.org/download/).

### Should I divide homework with my partner?

No, you should pair program. Assignments build sequentially, so it's important to get a good understanding of all homework assignments.

### Will taking Fundies 1 in NUin (London) make me less prepared for Fundies 2 in Boston?

No, you will be just as prepared for Fundies 2 as those who took Fundies 1 in Boston.
