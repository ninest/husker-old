### Meal exchange

Meal swipes can be used at restaurants on campus that have a sign that says "Meal Exchange". Meal exchange can be used at locations listed on [nudining.com/public/meal-exchanges](https://nudining.com/public/meal-exchanges).

There are weekly limits for the number of meal exchanges (see up).

### Outtakes

At Stetson West, you can use your unused meal swipes to get "grocery food items" (like chips, cheetos, sandwiches, salads, water, drinks, fruits, etc)

- **1 meal swipe** becomes **10 points**.
- See the [opening hours](https://nudining.com/public/hours) for Outtakes at Stetson West
- You can use a maximum of 3 swipes here
